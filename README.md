This is a basic recipe website to demonstrate the HTML knowledge I've learned.

End of Project Reflection:
I had lots of fun finding recipes to some of my favorite dishes. Though, while finding images to use, the dimensions of the dutch baby pancake image was huge. It would be useful to find a way to limit the width of said image.

Update: I was able to change the dimensions of the images with CSS.
